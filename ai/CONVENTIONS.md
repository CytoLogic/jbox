# When writing code in this project, you MUST follow these principles
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, etc. Names should reveal intent.
- When comments are used, they should add useful information that is not \
readily apparent from the code itself.

- Use the gnu C23 standard for all C code.

- Limit lines to 80 characters maximum.

- Functions and variable names must be in snake_case.
- Structs and types must be in PascalCase.
- Global constants must be in ALL_CAPS.

- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Surround top-level function, struct, and type definitions with two blank lines.
- Surround all operators with single spaces; Ex. (a + b).

- Use parentheses to signify precedence.
- Multiline formulas should ALWAYS break BEFORE the operator.
- When writing a multiline string, break lines with "\".

- DO NOT include libraries outside the GNU C Standard Library unless EXPLICITLY Prompted to do so.
